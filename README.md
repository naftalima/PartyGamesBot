Telegram bot that makes it easy to invite friends to play during (and after) quarantine.

Due to the coronavirus disease outbreak (COVID-19), fear and anxiety can be overwhelming and cause strong emotions. We need to take care of our mental health during this chaos.

We developed this bot to encourage social interactions.
Stay home! Stay safe!  🏠💚

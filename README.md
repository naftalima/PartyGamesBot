Telegram bot that makes it easy to invite friends to play during (and after) quarantine.

Due to the coronavirus disease outbreak (COVID-19), fear and anxiety can be overwhelming and cause strong emotions. We need to take care of our mental health during this chaos.

We developed this bot to encourage social interactions.

**Stay home! Stay safe!** üè†üíö
